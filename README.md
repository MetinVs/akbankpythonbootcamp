Project: Pizza Order System

This project was developed using Python as part of the Global AI Hub Akbank Python Bootcamp. The goal was to design a simple yet functional pizza ordering system where users can select their preferred pizza type, customize toppings, and receive a detailed order summary including pricing and payment details.

The project focuses on applying core Python concepts such as:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
File handling
User input and validation
Modular coding practices
It serves as a beginner-friendly simulation of a real-world food ordering system, designed entirely through the command line. This project helped reinforce my understanding of Python fundamentals and how to structure a basic software application.
